Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Raj Jeyaraj; strategy, operations, and EDI leader with 12 years' experience empowering organisations with communities up to 127K and revenues of Â£1M-6M. I've served 20+ organisations through crisis and critical periods to performance by architecting strategic and technical solutions that build morale, develop new income streams, and increase engagement. 

I quickly identify and implement change today that sustains long-term growth. I thrive in fast-paced environments and tight constraints, partnering with inspired leadership and boards open to innovative solutions. 

Letâ€™s talk about the small to big changes we can make to unlock human potential at work and increase impact.
